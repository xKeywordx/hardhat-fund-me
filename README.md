# Sample Hardhat Project

Basic Hardhat "Fund Me" contract.
You can deploy funds as long as the minimum amount is 50 USD and only the owner of the contract can withdraw the funds from the contract - so don't send anything to it.

The contract will store the addresses of the funders into a mapping along with the amount funded.
You can access this info with the help of the getter functions.
